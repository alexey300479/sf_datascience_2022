### 1. Project description
Guess the number guessed by the computer in the minimum number of attempts

### 2. What case are we solving
Need to write a program that guesses the number in the minimum number of attempts

**Сompetition conditions**
- The computer thinks of an integer from 1 to 100 and we need to guess it. By "guess" is meant to write a program that guesses the number.
- The algorithm takes into account information about whether the number we need is greater or not.

**Quality metric**
The results are evaluated by the average number of attempts at 1000 repetitions

**What are we practicing?**
Learning to write good python code
